# qr-component

I had never used a google font the correct way now that I searched, so It was my firs time using the
`@import url()` filled with the appi of the family that was requested, and was located in Google fonts. However in the meantime I looked and learned about the existence of `@font-face` to specify a custom font, from either a remote server or a local installed font. I tried to make it work with `@font-face` but couldn't figure it out. It will be an assignment for the next challenge.

I work with the developer tools fo Mozilla and I encounter the 'error' called FOUC for Flash Of Unstyled Content, meaning that for a brief moment -less tha a second- the page appears unstyled while the script loads. In stackoverflow I saw the recommendation of writing a script befor the end of <head> and it worked.  









##Continued dev

In the next challenge I want to use `@font-face` with a locally installed font.
